## **ðŸ“Œ Introduction**  
This project leverages **Python libraries** such as **Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud** for **data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization**. The workflow includes:  

âœ” Importing and cleaning the dataset  
âœ” Preprocessing text data for analysis  
âœ” Converting text into **numerical vectors** using **TF-IDF**  
âœ” Training a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
âœ” Evaluating the model's **performance**  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Installation**  
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install them using:  

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
```

Additionally, download the necessary **NLTK stopwords** by running the following command in Python:  

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Usage**  
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.  
2. **Download the dataset** and place it in the project directory.  
3. **Run the script** using Python.  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Preprocessing**  
The text data undergoes **cleaning and transformation** to improve the modelâ€™s performance. This involves:  
âœ” **Removing punctuation and special characters**  
âœ” **Converting text to lowercase**  
âœ” **Eliminating stopwords using NLTK**  

These steps help in structuring the text for better analysis and accurate model predictions.

## **ðŸ“Œ Analysis**  
Data analysis includes:  
ðŸ“Š **Exploring unique ratings**  
ðŸ“Š **Visualizing the distribution of ratings using countplots**  
ðŸ“Š **Converting ratings into binary labels** (e.g., reviews with a score â‰¤4 are considered **negative**, while 5+ are **positive**).  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Model Training**  
1. **Transforming text data into numerical vectors** using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.  
2. **Splitting the dataset** into **training and testing sets** to evaluate model performance.  
3. **Training a Decision Tree Classifier** to categorize reviews as **positive or negative**.  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Evaluation**  
To assess the modelâ€™s performance, we use:  
âœ” **Accuracy Score** to measure overall performance.  
âœ” **Confusion Matrix** to visualize:  
   - **True Positives (TP)**
   - **True Negatives (TN)**
   - **False Positives (FP)**
   - **False Negatives (FN)**  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Conclusion**  
The **Decision Tree Classifier** performs effectively on the given dataset, achieving a **high accuracy score**.  
ðŸ’¡ Future enhancements could include:  
ðŸ“Œ **Training on a larger dataset** for improved generalization.  
ðŸ“Œ **Exploring other machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or Deep Learning models) for better accuracy.
